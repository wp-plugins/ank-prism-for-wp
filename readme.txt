== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you create this plugin ? =

I could not found a better plugin to use Prism in WP.
This is my small contribution to the Open Source Community.

= What is the difference between this and other plugins ? =

I have downloaded and tried 3 most downloaded plugins for Prism. One of them force you to use short-code.
One of theme says that files will be loaded whenever required. One of them force you to use custom fields.
None of them tried to give same interface like Prismjs.com. My plugin have tried to give same interface like Prismjs.com.

So basically this plugin is just a just a controller. That will allow to select from available languages, theme, plugins.
Then pack CSS and JS files. Lastly enqueue them to front end. It does not force you to use short-code at all.
Just follow the instruction from Prismjs.com and you are ready to go.

= What this plugin actually do ? =

This plugin allow you to select from available themes, languages and plugins.
Then create (pack) JS and CSS files, store them on disk and enqueue them to front end.
Everything will be served from local server.

Each time you save new settings , this plugin write processed js and css code to two separate files.
There may be some chance that plugin unable to create/write these files. These files are essential to front end.

Possible reason are ->

  and change file permission of this plugin folder.
